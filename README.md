# Todo React App

* Data is used from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos).
* Some Random todos were fected and stored in [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).
* Each `todo` have `title` and `completed` properties.
* Based upon the `completed` property each todo has some status(`Done` or `Remaining`) and color(Red or Green).
* React Table has 2 columns for `title` and `status`.
* By clicking on not completed i.e. `Remaining` todos we can mark them `Active`.
* And By clicking on `Active`todos we can mark then `Done`.
* Each time after Reloading we get some random todos.
